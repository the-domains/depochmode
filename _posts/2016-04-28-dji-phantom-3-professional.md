# DJI Phantom 3 Professional

For my birthday my missus got me a DJI Phantom 3 Pro (P3P). It wasn' t entirely her idea, I asked if I could exchange her gift to this instead.

Drones have been flying around for sev eral years now and I never really fancied flying one. I know I would never have bought one with my own money. Not because the DJI Phantom sucked but more because i wanted to be the subject of the video and not the person taking the video

Now Ive flown the P3P about 4 times now. I'm fairly confident with what it can do. I'm quite happy with it so far. 

It really is quite easy to fly. My first attempt I had watched a couple of YouTube videos. I started out in beginner mode by default and was limited to a specific range. I got notifications to upgrade my drone and remote but I was already ut of the house and figured this should still work.
